                        ** Validation unknown vendor extensions **

There is nothing you can do to validate vendor extensions except to not use them. 
Please explain to your client that there is nothing you can do about this since those errors will help support browser compatibility efforts.
 The validator only validates against valid code. The vendor extensions are proprietary code.
 As such it will always be invalid.
